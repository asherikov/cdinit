"Contrib" area for Dinit
------------------------

This directory is intended for "extras" that may have been contributed by others, that do not
really belong as part of the main Dinit distribution. In some cases they may be incomplete
and they have not necessarily been tested by Dinit maintainers. Please do not open issues or
request help in using these extras. Patches with clear improvements are welcome.

See the README in each subdirectory for relevant information.
